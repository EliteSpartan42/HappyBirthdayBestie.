<br> </br>

Our extraordinary friendship, like the most beautiful stories, had a humble beginning that felt like destiny. It all started when you randomly invited me to watch a play with you. I remember being a bit perplexed as to why you chose me, and I must admit, I'm not entirely sure why I said yes. But looking back now, I am profoundly thankful that I did. I can say with absolute certainty that that moment was the catalyst for our remarkable journey together.
<br> </br>

Then came your play, an event that I entered with curiosity and exited with a heart full of admiration. I had no clue what to expect from the stage, but the sight of you, so joyful and thrilled, rushing towards me with enthusiasm and nearly slipping in your exuberance, was a first for me. It left an indelible mark on my heart, a symbol of the happiness and surprises our friendship has brought into my life. I eagerly anticipate many more such moments with you.
<br> </br>

Our connection, expressed through our writings, is a testament to the depth of our bond. We've penned countless poems and essays, exchanged words of comfort and encouragement, and I can even recite "SAME FLAME" word for word. It remains my most cherished possession, a tangible representation of the beautiful connection we share. I hope this gives you the same sense of warmth and belonging it gives me.
<br> </br>

In the world of biology, where monotony occasionally threatens to creep in, our playful antics and shared laughter have made the subject come alive. I've playfully closed your book, scribbled in the margins, or initiated spontaneous tickle attacks that ended with your infectious laughter filling the room. These are the moments that make life truly vibrant.
<br> </br>

Yet,My most treasured moments in our friendship was your first visit. I was overwhelmed with anxiety, wanting everything to be perfect. Seeing your face light up after trying my French toast, witnessing your smile as you watched Your Name or when we played Paw Patrol,Observing your inner child emerge for a while was nothing short of beautiful. It was a testament to the depth of our connection and the genuine joy we bring to each other's lives.
<br> </br>

Of course, our journey together has not been without its challenges. In moments of darkness, when our darkest thoughts and feelings spilled out, we were there for each other, holding the light and guiding one another toward brighter days.
<br> </br>

Bestie, you have been a radiant beacon in my life, illuminating my path with your friendship, love, and unwavering support. I could never express my gratitude enough. Here's to countless more shared moments, laughter, and heart-to-heart conversations. Always remember, I love you unconditionally, I am endlessly proud of you, and I raise my glass to you, with all my heart. ðŸ¥‚ <3 </font>
